prefix = prefix for commands (probably will be removed in later versions once I figure out how to make per-server settings). token = bot's token for logging in. nsfw = if nsfw commands are enabled (same as prefix), thehost = sql host (domain), theuser = your username for said host, thepassword = your username for said host.
